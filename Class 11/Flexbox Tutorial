    Flexbox Architecture

        Main axis
            Main-start
            Main-end

        Cross axis
            Cross-start
            Cross-end

    We uses flexbox on the parent class of the elements we want to shape


    Flexbox is one directional
        
        We either work with rows or with columns

        Grid allows us to work with rows and columns together


    Flexbox mostly works on the parent container

    Bit it also has properties like align-self that work on the child item level. 

    There is also shorthand to make flexbox easier. 

    There is a flexbox cheat cheat in this tutorial

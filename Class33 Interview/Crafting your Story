Crafting your Story 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoweoDsi5ZI

alrighty folks welcome welcome welcome uh i started the recording i won't
delete it this time i promise i'm so sorry about the last one uh remo has its quirks as we are finding
out but uh hopefully this won't go well so if you weren't here last time we talked about the importance of
crafting your story this is the thing that's going to help you get
hired it is the thing that is going to help you focus your job search it is the thing that's going to
help you stand out when you apply and so crafting your story is one of the most
important things you can do as we start to gear up for the second half of program
and really start to focus in on that job search and so i want to take some time for you to see
how i help students craft their story so you can get some inspiration and some ideas about how you might craft your own so
hopefully we get a wide range of experiences tonight and we'll we'll try and do some of these live
and hopefully come up with something good and at least show you how to think through the process so
let's jump right into it um i'm gonna give you the ability to turn
on your cam and my cats let me go and do that right
now cool all right you should be able to turn on
your camera and your microphone and you should be live with us
hello hey how's it going it's okay it's okay
i'm really excited i was super hyped and then i was like oh i have to speak um okay okay there's only 70 of us here
don't worry about it you're all good we're all friends cool i
hope so yeah all right so you can see the encouragement in chat you got this uh tell us a little bit
about your story your background the things that you're proud of the things you're worried about and then let's see if we can come up
with a with a story live okay uh i didn't prepare this so i'm so sorry
this is good i want it i want it raw i want it unfiltered let's do it live
cool so i don't necessarily have a long work history i graduated from university summer of
2019 i did a degree in art history in a scottish university saint andrews which
is supposed to be like one of the top three in the uk um which i thought would get me a job
but it hasn't which is okay we're here um so i graduated in our history
and then i did really well i got a first class honors i did a big internship at the guggenheim
um museum for two months but i kind of that was from yeah whatever goodnight
it's a big deal maybe um but so i did that for two months but i
realized kind of i'm being severely underpaid being paid like 500 euro for working 50
hours a week which is kind of like 600 i'm doing all the same things it's like
people who are getting a full uh being forced to clean the gallery
being forced to like uh i had to prepare talk for like a private tour of the
of the gallery for two hours prepared everything myself it cost like 300 for the people to come
and get this tour but uh i didn't get anything from it which is kind of like
so i felt a bit disillusioned i kept looking for jobs afterwards then that was like 2020 i had plans to do more
internships but one called one coveted uh hit i kind of just thought
um maybe maybe this is not what i wanted to actually want to like earn money and make a living for myself
rather than having to do another like 10 unpaid internships to get into the art world um so
yeah and then i came here that's it all right so
when you're at university did you ever touch anything remotely related to computers
no nothing when did you start the idea of like maybe wanting to get into software engineering
um so i i got well it's a crazy story i ended up being stuck in japan for six
months i came to visit my boyfriend there and he kind of just said uh in august of last year why don't you
learn a new skill like coding and i said sounds good and then i went online free
software with cam i found leon and we went there so only august
as one does the best place to learn code online there you go um okay
and you you've shared this online so i guess i'm i'm okay saying it but you have like a store too
right so you you do like commerce online and everything right kind of it was more of like i just crafted a lot
of those things but i haven't been doing it since since i started coding that much it's
just the leftovers of what i did before but yeah i had two sales there
that's it cool all right so you you you have you have the ultimate get out of jail
free card right you graduated into
a pandemic yeah right so so like you you you you went to
university you graduated with with honors you got one of the most prestigious
kind of internships that you could you could get and then i'm sure the guggenheim closed
because of the pandemic yeah they shut down because it wasn't genius that was like all right yeah
so that that that's where that's where we start uh at university i studied art history
uh you can talk about like why you studied art history at st andrews which is one of the best programs in the world
after saint andrews i left to go to the guggenheim where i landed one of the most prestigious internships in art history
and then the pandemic hit and the museum shut down so i
left to japan to work on my crafting and built out an
online store and really fell in love with not only the kind of practical
expression of art but the software and marketing and the ability that my ideas can go
out into the world and fell in love with that ability to kind of proliferate my art
and that led me down the software engineering route i really wanted to understand how i was able to bring my art online i
really wanted to understand how i could build experiences like those at the
guggenheim but online right so i was i was i was in japan
practicing my art bringing my art online and constantly thinking about well while the museums are shut down
how can i bring this this skill i've crafted to the masses right and i kept going deeper and deeper
into software engineering and now for the past past year i've been honing my software engineering
skills my digital marketing skills uh with the sole goal of
bringing my artistic visions to life through code
so something so so i think i think the the the the things we're going to hit
here are went to university you went to a great university great
program got a great internship pandemic shut everything down right that's your get out of jail free card
now what did we do in that gap that shows that you're ready for a career in software
engineering well we have like these two paths we can take you can say i was really about really interested in bringing my art
online or creating experiences like the ones at the guggenheim but online or we can also go the slightly different
routes like all right shut down i wanted to keep my my creative juices going
i started an online store fell in love with the idea of bringing art online which led me to software engineering for
the past year i've been honing my software engineering skills i would love to find a company that
enables me to combine my two loves like creative expression and software engineering
yeah that's awesome yeah because that's definitely yeah good good it's it's like i
absolutely adored art history it was the best thing i did so it's just kind of not something that's a viable career
path for me right now so it's a hundred percent something i want to bring into my coding i just haven't figured out how
i can do that just yet yeah so i i actually 100 agree with james p and this is where i was
going to go is that your 100 hours project should be an online art museum
or or crypto art i heard that yeah i only heard about
that last week that's crazy uh so if you don't if you don't know what crypto crypto artist i know if cash is in here if cash you're in here you
can probably speak better than i can but crypto art is this idea that like yeah they're nfts non-fungible tokens
so the idea is that like art now is different anyone can like go up to the mona lisa take a photo
and now have that photo that can be shared around the world right so who owns that art and so the idea of
putting like art behind nfts or combining art and crypto is like a way of showing like
ownership over time of the art and so this very famous digital artist people just sold 3.5 million dollars
worth of art in one weekend uh so that's that's wild and so i think
you could latch on to that idea i think there's a really strong path from hey i went to the one of the best
art history programs in the world i got one of the most prestigious internships at the guggenheim pandemic hit
closed down and i shifted gears to being like i don't want to ever i don't want this to ever happen again i
started practicing software engineering over the past year i've been building digital art experiences and now i'm
ready to bring like that creativity that passion that software engineering skills to a company like yours that's so cool
and the other thing is that you're still kind of you're close that you can still go for more of the like um university
entry-level roles so like in software there are there are entry-level roles and then there are entry-level roles that are geared
towards like recent university grads you're still in the running for those and so when it comes time for us to focus your
resume and your your your like your pitch you're gonna really have two different
application routes that you're gonna go down so anybody that's here that's like under
24 or just got out of university uh there there's like there's slightly
more job opportunity for super super entry level like roles that's just something to be
keeping in mind how do you feel about that i love it the only thing
is if i mention the art shop like it's it's not a it's not a good business it's very very
minimal and basic how would i navigate if they doesn't say that so okay so if they go deep and they
say what was the art that you're working on uh so i have a very interesting hobby
i love to make felt art i i love the idea like so so here's the
thing when you're interviewing people love
like people love software engineers that are also artistic right they they like people that like
can think like design oriented that could bring some of that perspective to the engineering
realm and so you you shouldn't shy away from that right you can say like i have like i
have this skill that i'm really proud of something i really love doing but it's very niche so i needed to
build tools that could get my work out there so that people could like find my art
and i started with like the normal route which is like etsy and then i went off the deep end with
this project going into nft crypto backed art
that's cool all right and so you can you can you can use your this is a prime example
of how your 100 hours project is going to be super critical to your story
because your 100 hours project is going to be the transition into the job for you like
uni job pandemic really bringing your art online falling
in love with software engineering want to bring your creativity and software engineering skills to a new company
right like that that's the path there for you i like it so would you rec i think i saw
a question that popped in my eyes uh so would you recommend i apply only for like creative companies or
someone else yeah how would i apply to those i don't think you have to limit the roles that you apply to but we often
talk so i always say you're gonna apply to 60 companies that's cool you're going to have 10 that
are really good matches companies that have like an art bent
companies that have likes like that or might be like in the art market right there are
all these new crypto art auction houses that are popping up that would be the place i would i like if i
was in your shoes my 100 hours project would be some sort of crypto art and then um i would apply to companies
that are in that realm or blockchain s-type companies those would be like my hyper focus 10 either art or
or something in that realm and we can find 10 really good ones for you and then you're gonna have like 20 more
on top of that that are just general and then like 30 on top of that that are like i don't know but we're going to try
thank you i love it because i struggled so much of like javascript and art history i was like there's no way
there's no way they are related in any way so and so that that that's the power of the 100 hours project for everyone
here your your 100 hours project is the bridge for most of you into your your first role
people people want to know if you can code and if they want to work with you for the next two years right and so your hundred dollars
project shows that you can code and all the all the passion you throw into that project lets them know they want to
work with you for the next two years all the little things we can do in there that are extra are helpful too but
yeah all right how do you feel about that i love it thank you all right so i am going to
give the powers to the next person
nicholas gonna go find you
round of applause for cat it's not easy getting up here folks bearing your soul your history
all right you should have the ability to come on up now
what's up leon what's up hey how you doing pretty good how about you not too bad
not too bad all right so i know where you went to uni yeah because you're wearing the hoodie
i'll start there right i went to school for music and due
to some financial hardships with my family i was forced to either drop out or
and work or stick it out and go to school so i decided to stick it out and to pay for school i started a
business buying and selling storage lockers where i found some crazy stuff and sell them online so i did that and
from doing four years of that i decided to transition to marketing and market research where we learned
how to take data we used r to work with data and then i also did some general marketing eventually uh
graduated and worked in some general marketing roles had some a taste of some html and css
with working in things like mailchimp from there worked another marketing job
that had another business that owned 17 mcdonald's and they needed someone to do iot for
them so i did that and were there i learned a lot about user interfaces and how to troubleshoot
using software for a major company like mcdonald's and my main responsibility
there was to ensure that anything that was connected to the internet stayed up and connected because anytime
that something would go down it would lead to a loss of sales upwards to six percent a minute wow and i realized
that um the people that were working inside of a mcdonald's store the the user interface was too hard to
navigate uh when it came to using a computer to troubleshoot so they would just use a phone
and using the phone to cost more money and it would lead to longer down times and while i
was there was trying to develop a simple user interface just using html and css where they could say hit this
broken and they would go to the next thing it would just be a simple way for them to fix it
and then the pandemic kit was out of work and started learning how to code for
myself to build like my own personal portfolio and then also to try to get some
type of uh online business going like a startup or just to be creative online and
all right so it's quick and dirty of my background i want to make sure so you were in uni you left ran your storage business for
four years and then you went back to uni and graduated or
i was doing the storage and doing school part-time okay so it took me a lot yeah it took me
a long time to graduate because i was trying to pay for it and then doing the storage business and hustling selling stuff online
that's where i switched from music to marketing because i saw the importance of marketing online because that's where
all my business was coming from yep um and then just went towards general marketing and market research
because i was really interested in the psychology of of consumers yep yeah and so
um how so how did you go from market research to the iot
like you were you in charge of the tech portion of that or were you um or were you like helping
that business like were you on the ground like helping with the systems or yeah so i was on the ground i would
go and implement the systems and then also uh mcdonald's is going through a very
uh i guess they're upgrading a lot of their stores they have a lot more technology implemented into
the stores so there's a lot of troubleshooting and implementation of the software and training
and what company was doing the iot stuff was it like a tech company or was it through mcdonald's proper
it was a mcdonald's owner operator so under their enterprise they had mcdonald's and then
they had some other enterprises going on as well and where where is this at where at located in california
it's in uh yeah in ontario california okay cool
all right so you were in university uh you realize university is very damn expensive
and so yeah while you're in university you started a small business and you ran that small business for four
years while completing your degree when you graduated with your degree not only did you have the degree but you had
this fantastic background in marketing and had all the experience of running your your startup
for those four years to help pay for your university and uh right out of university folks
recognized your strong marketing skill uh you were in the marketing world for a while and then you wound up at one of
the large one of the largest owner operators of mcdonald's
in california and i don't know if you know about this but the technology
behind those large conglomerations of kind of fast food change is immense a lot of iot a lot of things
that you just don't realize that these larger organizations rely on and so i got sucked up into that world
where i was working on these massive systems that if they went down [Music]
that was real loss of revenue and so i got really good at not only the marketing side of
like how to um make these systems robust so that you
could perform your business and like how to sell these systems but then also how to maintain them
and actually let me roll this back let me roll this right i want to go that angle i want to angle all right i was at university
i was in university and while i was at university uh i started a a startup and that
startup grew and it was i was able to fund my education through that startup when i graduated
with my degree not only did i have a degree but i had this really strong marketing
uh engineering background that i was ready to apply to other companies i wound up working
for one of the largest owner operators of mcdonald's chains in california and i went to work not
only with their marketing but i also went to work really trying to intimately understand how their business operated
i had ran my business successfully for four years but i wanted i wanted to do something bigger uh more more more people
larger payroll i wanted to see like how big business gets built and i was in charge of managing the iot
infrastructure so really technical the the lifeblood of these chains
and i found that it just sucked and these companies rely on this
software to get their work done and it goes down and they lose money they lose profit and i thought there had
to be a better way when the pandemic hit and business slowed at all these restaurants
i took some time to work on my software engineering skills because i knew i could build better
systems more robust systems if you look at this project that i've been building for the past six months
this is my take on the software i wish i had when i was helping one of the largest
owner operators in california right and so now i'm ready to bring this wealth of
not only marketing and managerial experience and and startup knowledge but also this
really strong engineering background and i want to work with a
company that values user experience and really understands what people go
through right what people go through when they use software because i saw how hard folks had to work at all
the different chains i was in and out of every single day and i don't want folks that are already putting in double shifts to not have a
ui that makes sense so i'm really excited to be here today to be interviewing with you today because i see the op the software you
create i see the real impact it has on your on your customers and this is the type of place i want to
be wow cool so we're going to go
thank you so much we're going to go university
when i was in university i started a company that actually helped me pay my way
through university graduated not only with a degree but a really strong entrepreneurial mindset a really strong
skill set i was very fortunate that one of the largest owner operators
of fast food chains in california recognized that that hustle that talent
and and that that that experience and i went to work managing the iot systems
at these really large chains got to see day in and day out how much of a struggle it was for
individuals to to work with these systems and they're already working so hard and they're just butting their heads up
against this technology that's archaic and doesn't work for anyone when the pandemic hit i had some extra
time i took that time to reinforce my engineering skills that i had started when i was
running my company during university and really leaned into this idea of wanting to build robust scalable
software that works well for end users and that's why i'm applying to your company today i'm flying because i see
the impact that your software can have on the end user and this is where i want this is the kind of job that i want to be it's the kind of company i want to be
working for and you can see the projects i've been working over on the past six months are all about how to make the user
interfaces and the customer experience better and it's something i see you're doing that's why i want to work here
cool that's awesome yeah that's yeah that's that nails it that
nails it everything i've been trying to say yeah appreciate that so much all right any questions anything you're worried
about uh i really don't have any words it's really just packaging it up
and uh and telling myself because then if they ask any questions i got the data i got the facts back yeah exactly
yeah cool so uh chat what do we think anything that we should we should plug in anything that we should add or yeah
it's lit that was ace cool all right well hey i
appreciate it thank you let's uh let's keep that party going no worries uh up next
i'm uh i'm gonna give you the power to come up okay i need dead bodies
dead stuff but not bodies
i guess dead bodies but not of humans yeah
all right if you go ahead and turn off your cam and mike i think emma will be able to turn theirs on thank god cool round of a round of
applause folks not easy coming up here bearing your story
hi i think my camera is not working sorry we can just do sound if the camera's not working
yeah it's not showing the picture how you doing i'm nervous nervous that's all right
nervous is fine we will we'll get through it together right yeah all right i'm used to this feeling
cool um so i'll start i guess so back in high school i fell in love with uh with blogging so
i self-taught html and css and how to edit
um plugins like jquery plugins um java php i
self-taught my um ftp and i learned how to use a little of my sql although not that good
um i dropped it because i went to uni i graduated in 2015 with a theater degree um
and then i did some websites for actors because i'm an actor as well
and then i left uni and then i became a server and then that
shut down because of the pandemic and during the pandemic i was like what
do i know and what do i like that i can make into a career and
i found you perfect same thing that's it yeah uh where were you where were you a
server app um in l.a um i was a server at yeah
at different restaurants mexican restaurant japanese um restaurant
and where did you do uni out season so california state uni northridge
what was your blog on back in the day life i was just yeah just
blogging about high school going to uni music it was just teenager stuff i guess
for sure um were you while you were a server you were still
trying to do the act that you were still trying to kind of get acting gigs too right yeah so i was going to auditions but i
was also working in theaters um so because of uni and because of other people that i've
met through the theater world i was also i've also stage managed i've done i've been light operator i've
been sound operator so i was also doing that and then once the pandemic hit like i'm
assuming like roll calls and like like the auditions and everything kind of just stopped right
yeah everything's right especially if you're not an a-lister cool all right so let's take us let's go
let's look at this and you did theater right in university yes yes all right uh so
i've always been passionate about the arts uh early in my life i
remember hacking on blogs using my sql and html and css
i was there when jquery was taking off i just had this immense passion for creating stuff online
that drove me to like learn how it worked and to build code and to eventually build sites
and blogs for other folks i went to university and followed my passion which was theater
once i graduated i did the normal kind of actor grind where i am interviewing
and doing anything i can to get more and more interviews but i had this skill set and
throughout kind of getting gigs i was always building blogs and websites for
other actors i always relied on my engineering skill set to provide while i was doing the the
actor grind the pandemic kit and the acting
kind of auditions dried up but i was very fortunate to have this really strong engineering skill set
and i said you know what let's go full bore uh with this skill set and
rekindled that creative passion and really over the past six to nine months
have just been really pushing myself engineering wise and rekindling that
passion i had those 10 20 plus years ago uh surfing the forums with html and css
and uh you can see that i've been building not only projects for tons of acting clients but i've also
built some really strong and that's we're going to plug in your 100 your like 100
hour project so i think the the route here is to since you were
building blogs and doing all that like show that passion from that passion you went to university
you followed another passion which was theater uh i think everyone kind of somewhat
knows what like the normal actor route is is that like you're always doing auditions
and that you are um
yeah you're grinding right and so you're gonna you can you can i think i think that's something that like is gonna be really
impactful when you start applying that like that that that hustle mentality is really
going to stand out at startups so i'm already thinking like your your solid 10 are going to be startups
like startups are going to respect the hell out of like side hustling and doing what you want to
do to follow your passion like that's going to be a huge slam dunk when it comes to like startups
and yes blah saying if they're from la they they know what that hustle looks like so
yeah back in my youth i was always passionate about
engineering i would build blogs html css i was there as jquery was taking off had
a really strong love for engineering early on in my life i went to university i followed another
passion which was theater and after graduating i did the theater grind
where you're going to audition after audition but i never lost sight of my engineering
roots and i used that to help fund my acting career i would build blogs and websites for the
actors that needed a place to put their headshots their past their past auditions things like
that and that fueled my ability to follow my passion in theater pandemic hit
auditions dried up but i was very fortunate a lot of my friends that were
in in in the acting space they didn't have any work i had the ability to fall back on my
engineering skill set i took the past nine plus nine six six to nine months to really lean into
uh bringing my engineering skill set up to date to building some fantastic products and
now i'm excited to join a company like yours where i can kind of bring my passion for engineering
to life where i can uh work with individuals
that are excited to build products that are in the like entertainment industry
right so i think that's gonna be like your niche right you're going to go after after folks that are doing something in
like the creative video type space and since you you're you're still in la
like la area nearby then yeah so then there's then there's there's you
you've got a solid 10 startup type companies that are doing
custom netflix competitors and so you can lean into your theater background is a huge strength
you can lean into your engineering background as a huge strength and they're going to respect that hustle
okay thank you what do you think how do you feel about that one yeah it's like perfect could you go
interview for myself hey we're gonna get enough practice you'll feel comfortable with it too
chat what do we what are we feeling what are we missing what do we need to put in are you doing all right
i think they like it i think so all right thank you liam yeah no worries
all right next up we got paul i'm gonna give you the power
give me a second here right paul you
should be able to come up now you just turn on your uh make the camera hey
how's it going good good all right um so obviously i'm
a little bit older than most of the other people here um so i've got a lot of story um i actually work for just one
company for really my whole working career and i was their i.t manager for 25 years
and i'm in uh northeast ohio they had a couple other uh locations around the country but um
they closed down uh the cleveland location in the fall of 2019
and so everybody was out of a job including myself and so i took a little bit of time and
decide all right i'm going to go back to school when i worked there i did pretty much
all kinds of stuff it was a small company so i wore a lot of hats i did accounting
a lot i did payroll um you know pretty much anything electronic you know if it wasn't working they'd
bring that to me um i even did the purchasing manager for for a couple years for their uh
all their supply chain stuff so a wide wide variety of expo exposures um when i left
um i thought that i wanted to go into like cyber security or something like that
all the technology that they had was antique and i've told some of the students here that
um my one exposure to coding before this other than um like high school you know
pascal and fortran and all that um was working on their database for the shop floor program
and it was a database from 1994 and it was dos based
through you know windows xt and windows 7 and all that stuff so a lot of experience there um
when i decided i need to upgrade my skills because i felt that my skills were out of date
if i wanted to go out and do something else and that's when i found you and you're posting on reddit and i'm
like that sounds like what i want to do and uh got involved here and um i've just
loved it ever since cool uh so the the this company was like what was
what were they working on what were they doing um they built hardware for the transportation industry
um they were all over the place but probably their biggest customers would be like heavy trucks semi-truck um they had some
in aviation and it was like the tech in those trucks like the gps and stuff like that
the actual the physical hardware so like oh okay um in a semi truck like the paddle latch to
open the door the grab handle to climb up those kind of things yeah uh okay how many people are at the
company uh 25 at our location it's about 200 with all the locations involved
okay and um were you all one of the bigger suppliers of that
hardware the only supplier that hardware or that was part of the problem and how
we ended up getting shut down was because as time went on the hardware became more and more
commodity and we lost a lot of our business to people importing from china
yeah and um so we kind of got forced out um that's what happened there okay and
you did you go to university and right into the company or straight from the company um i had a
couple years at uh university i did not graduate of course that was ancient times ago and then i worked um
for a uh company in nashville for four years and did tech support for them and um
yeah and then and then it was it was really it was 25 years at the current company you said yeah so i worked i worked at all three
of their locations at some time or another but it was like 23 years at the cleveland area and what
was the uh like your final title before you left um information man
information technology manager okay um
all right so if i was to interview so let's go through this so we're in an
interview all right so for the past 25 years i've
worked in kind of the technology behind the transportation industry
if you've ever been on like a highway and you saw one of the latches on a truck uh the company i was at for 25 years
built that hardware there's a good chance if you've ever seen some heavy machinery that's involved in transportation
we had our hands on it as you can imagine kind of supplying that hardware to the transportation
industry uh was a very kind of intense uh very intense experience and i was in
charge of managing kind of all of the i.t behind our operations i rolled up my sleeves and got my hands
dirty with every single bit of it uh from databases that were built in 1994
to uh the the the actual technology that would get our products out the door and so i oversaw not only the um
the managing of that technology but also was there to kind of see that technology grow and change and morph and uh
unfortunately as the company kind of aged uh the the hardware that we were
supplying to the to the backbone of america started to be replaced by kind of cheaper commodities from overseas and so
uh the the parts that we were building and manufacturing uh would uh no longer be purchased
because people could get it cheaper elsewhere combine that with kind of uh
uh a let's i'm trying to i want to i want to see if i can play out like
i want to spin the older technology as a good thing
all right that's how we're going to do we're going to we're going to do it we're going to do it here we're going to do it that's how we're going to do it all right
so for the last 25 years i was an i.t manager at one of the largest
suppliers of hardware for the transportation industry in the u.s so if you're ever on the highway and you
saw one of those big latches there's a good chance that the company i was i was helping run it for
uh built that latch and so over the past 25 years i've done
everything from work with archaic databases from 1994 to roll my sleeves up and get my hands
dirty to get get the actual hardware out the door unfortunately going right into the
pandemic our entire operation shut down there was a couple of things that led to
it basically competition from overseas but also i got to see a company that was
stubborn we were using older databases we were using older technologies
and no matter how much i advocated for us to modernize our tech infrastructure
the folks that had been comfortable for 25 years were comfortable for 25 years and we didn't adapt
we could have still been the the backbone of american transportation we could have still been a
a leader in the space but the management above me wasn't willing to adapt or change and so
right into the pandemic we shut down our operations and i vowed that that would never happen
again and i've committed the last year of my life to modernizing my own engineering
background bringing my skills to the point where i can contribute to a team
and i want to join an organization that values
solid engineering principles and is a willing to adapt to change and
i want to roll my sleeves up and get dirty and all the cool new fun stuff so i see that you're using uh graphql
i see that you're using all the cool kids stuff this is the place i want to be i don't ever want to be in that situation again and
i want to bring my massive wealth of engineering experience iot management experience to your
company uh but i i i want to be on the front lines i want to i want to
i don't want to be in an office anymore i want to be in the pod writing the code and um and uh
helping kind of bring your company uh forward as well
yeah awesome that's a great story thank you so that's kind of that's kind of the route that i would
that i would go um i think i think the so
the the thing you always want to do is you want to sell the last company right and so i think with all the previous ones we sold the last company and so we
want to sell your company too so we want to we want to start off with like hey if you ever saw like those latches on the trucks that was probably us
uh we did that for 25 years uh but our technology was old i was using
databases from 1994. and you want to really throw that out there because that shows that you've been in tech and engineering for a while
um yeah and then the story of them not wanting to modernize gives you the chance to say like that's
not me though i want to be doing the latest and greatest i want to be pushing i want to be modernizing
i've taken the past six to nine months to like make sure my skill sets up to date and i want to be at a company that's
innovating i don't want to be at another company where we rest on our laurels i want to get my
i want to get my hands dirty i want to i want to be the one slinging the code and so i love
love love love how innovative your company is i love the tech stack and uh and how progressive
and and fast paced you all are moving that's the environment i want to be in
that's awesome and and that's right on because they were every time anybody would suggest you
know changing the technology it was always like so many roadblocks they just never would accomplish yeah
yeah perfect cool anything you're anything worried about anything chat anything that we should add anything that we're missing
i think we're good sounds good yep that was awesome all right cool
big round of applause for paul it's not hard it's not easy coming up here same thing for emma i think we got the
round of applause for emma as well all right uh i'm gonna bring up
james james you're gonna be our last of the evening let me go ahead and give you the power
here
all right james you should have the power to come on up now
leon's loving this the whole thing is like an rpg where leon gets to play a new hero every 15 minutes
my dm skills maybe are coming into play a little bit here
hey what's going on how you doing good how are you not too bad hey everybody i'm sure some
of you are familiar with my face the one the only the debacle
hi everyone alrighty so i think we got we got enough time to
get through one more and so let's let's let's let's leave it with a banger here let's hear a little bit about your story
and see where we can get well so part of my story um
starts when i was young um you know i grew up i started out my life really poor and
then my mom remarried and we gained a little bit of wealth and
exclusivity but we didn't know how to manage it you know um and my my life was also
very you know tumultuous um so when i graduated high school before graduation i took off like the
day classes ended i packed up my truck and i drove away and i went to new york city i went to
college at hunter college um coming out of college i
uh i was working in the mental health field um uh i i majored in psychology
uh and i was severely traumatized by that experience um working in the mental health field
was uh one of the worst things that ever happened to me and i i ended up not being able to ever
return to anything resembling that field um uh it was just the way people were
treated the way workers were treated the uh the a very uncaring system
uh and um from there i i spent some time unemployed i actually
have many gaps of of unemployment um my next visit big position that i had
was uh i worked as a distribution manager at a newspaper um
there i i was basically trained to take advantage of paper carriers
they were like nickel and dimed for things and um instead of you know pushing costs on the
customers which would which they felt would kill their business they they instead penalized drivers and kind
of manipulated them and and and really financially uh something dry so they were they weren't
making any money so it ended up you know me abusing the most uh the most um underprivileged people in
society uh and taking advantage of them in order to get our products out
and after i feel bad about it taking two years for me to quit that
job i also spent spent some time unemployed after that
i ended up working at uh oh excuse me i ended up working as a
uh as a carpenter i installed cabinets for a living i was also
taken advantage of there um i was paid like 14 an hour for installing cabinets um
i i was a supervisor for a team of installers and workers i scheduled our
our our bookings for our hotels i i did cold calling for jobs i project managed jobs and i was
making like 14.50 an hour um uh and they were making you know
when work was slow he'd bring us in and we'd work on his mansion we'd work on the landscape for his
mansion and stuff and i was getting paid like 14.50 an hour um i ended up quitting that job uh so i
have i also have a lot of times that i quit jobs on my record which makes it incredibly difficult for me
um i moved into another project management job with cabinets i ended up uh you know there was a poor
support system uh i ended up just being overwhelmed i ended up getting into a sales position
that was i forget what the term for it is but they would uh they would front you like the money for
a month your paycheck was a front for your commissions and um and so i had like three thousand
dollars a month that i was making and i had to make that back in money or else it was considered a debt and after like
i switched to that model and after that um i was only in there two months and i
was like there's no way i can make these quotas this is the same thing that's gonna that that i was tricked into doing for paper
care is gonna happen to me and so i quit that job i've worked as a
security guard i've worked as an uh at an exotic petting zoo i've worked as
an uber driver a poll inspector for elections a census enumerator i
couldn't find a place for myself in this world it felt crazy um okay
um so let's let's let's step back through this uh did you graduate from hunter
i was doing my final uh my final credits at my last job and i
was in dispute with them over those final credits and i was not given a degree
jesus even though for years i have said you know i went to enter for psychology i made it you know i it
wasn't true i couldn't deal with it i was um you know it was it was a huge failure for me what
what did you what were you doing specifically at the mental health facility
um i was doing um it was like general intake where you would um where
you would uh you know kind of go with the patients and then and then when they came through the facility you would assist with the site
the psychiatrists and psychologists but um but it wasn't like therapy itself
and then uh the next big role you had i'm sorry i'm like in the next week so we did the that and then distribution the
distribution um it was for the uh times of northwest
indiana it was a regional newspaper but it was like tied for the biggest newspaper in the area we had two
it served like 300 000 people okay so like one of the largest in the in the midwest yeah uh
and then some some different experiences some gig work there and uh when did
technology become a thing for you uh technology um i don't know it
honestly when i was working for the census i've dealt with technology at uber you know when i was doing sales for
cabinets i was also designing uh layouts for cabinets so i had to work
with like uh the user interface for those things which sucked but i can't really i don't really
remember enough about them at the census they had a horrible
ui for their system uh like it caused mass confusion this past census i was in
a numerator up until september when i got covered i got covid and then i was like i'm all in on leon's
class uh september 2nd i got coveted and then i used and then i just
grinded out javascript non-stop for my entire quarantine uh okay all right and then i lost and
then i could didn't have a job to come back to you because the census ended so okay
uh so we got some some bigger experiences so university mental health um
newspaper distribution and then uh kind of like cabinetry census
things like that so let's see the loop through these census detect through that the
distribution was kind of like middle kind of interfacing customers intakes
interfacing with customers all right so i went to university i studied psychology and university
and that kind of prepared me to kind of interact with humans in a very real way right out of
university i was working at one a very large mental health facility
on the east coast and i was in charge of kind of like intaking helping folks kind of get on
their right path uh that was very emotionally draining work
and i moved back to my my new like my normal roots which was in
the midwest and i was interfacing with humans again uh at one of the
helping distribute one of the largest kind of papers in the midwest uh you
know how papers turned out as a business model kind of as technology kind of started to take
over and uh yeah the paper industry started to decline so i was like all right i have this very strong skill set of kind of working with
individuals i have this very strong skill set of kind of learning some technology that helped me manage the distribution of
this paper and i wound up joining a organization that was a
large cabinetry now let's leave that out let's go straight to the senses so as the paper started to decline i
picked up a new role uh as a census what was the actual title name uh enumerator a numerator i picked up a
role as an enumerator with the census uh once again kind of flexing my skills to kind of interact with individuals
and and get them to give me the details that we need it for the census uh unfortunately the pandemic hit
and the the census kind of started to decline like the like the the need for
the the census after the pandemic wasn't there but one thing i had done throughout my entire career
whether it was um in the mental health facility helping distribute one of the largest papers in
the midwest or being very customer focused at the the uh at the sorry very
uh citizen focused during the census was i was always using this technology that
was supposed supposed to help the individuals that i served and it always fell short when i was working at
the mental health facility i was helping folks get intake and the forms were complicated and confusing the
tech didn't work when i was distributing this paper one of the largest papers in the midwest
the technology just didn't work that's why the paper started to decline during the census the technology just
did not work i couldn't get people to get the questions they needed quickly and effectively and so throughout my career i've always
been put in the position where the technology i relied on didn't
meet my needs and so when the pandemic hit i decided to take those that those night six to nine months to
be able to build the software i knew could impact the customers that i would go on to serve
and so i'm very very very focused on building strong software but my
real passion is software that works for the end user and so i'm really excited to interview with
your company because i see the the effect that your software has on the communities that it
serves right your users can can get in and do the things that they need to do effectively easy and not every company
has been able to do that and so i'm really excited to be interviewing with you today
all right so thank you yeah yeah so we're gonna say we're gonna
lean on the idea that like technology has always been something you've been working against uh and it
never served the individuals that you were trying to work with so when you're at the mental health facility never the intake technology
sucked when you were at the largest one of the largest newspapers in the midwest
the technology led to that newspaper's decline when you were doing the census that technology enabled you didn't
enable you to do your job effectively so you were always butting your head up against these scenarios
where technology was always the downfall you said you know what never again i'm gonna take the this time
i've gotten during the pandemic to to skill up and make sure that i can
write great software that serves individuals it intends to serve and i am really excited to work at your
company because i can see the impact that the software has on the users
and i know that it's a pleasure to work with and i want to be at a company where i can build great software
that honestly actually serves the individuals that they intend to serve
what do you think sounds good to me i think that's what i would lean into i think i think they um i think a really
uh bigger portion i would lean into like that paper too like the the distribute distributing and like
that's kind of there's something a little bit more here like where like you start to pick up tech along the way like you needed technology at the
distribution you needed technology at the census and it just didn't work
yeah i like that thank you everyone for your support i
really appreciate it uh you know i've been reading the chat as i went by really appreciate it thank you so much
yeah i like the the mentioning of the mentoring and streaming too i think that could be strong
i think yeah we could probably plug that at the end too like the um over the pandemic uh i took the chance
to strengthen my engineering skills and i started doing uh mentoring and and live streaming
the that that process and that journey and maybe you can even tie that back into the idea of like wanting to build
software that like actually works for users and so i'm building that software in the open building that software in
the open and trying to help people directly yeah there you go
i like that what do you think chat
cool all righty folks so we're we're over our hour uh
thank you to everyone that shared it's not easy coming up here bearing your soul and trying to craft your story live
we this this room will stay open so if you have some time
if you have another half an hour i highly encourage to get into a group there are some tables of two people
tables of four tables of six join a group try and craft your story
together practice your story that you might already have crafted and take some time to get to know your
fellow 100 dev's members and uh take the time this room will stay open until tomorrow
we're back together on sunday uh the ballicle will have their own channel on
discord very soon uh on sunday you'll see that channel go live so you'll always be able
to see dybalive as well so that we can kind of keep all of this going i will see
everyone on sunday have a wonderful weekend and uh be well

Notes:

    Programming: Writing instructions in a language a computer can undestand. 

    The rendering of the DOM is not the document.

    You can modify the DOM without manipulating the document.

    Escentials of programming
    
        Variables

        Conditionals
        
        Functions
        
        Loops

    Everything else is extra (objects, etc)


    Variables

            Declarations: let age;

                Declaring twice triggers an error.

                first charachter must not be a digit

                use camelCase

                names should describe the data that is trores

                'var' was the past version, substituted by let

                You can create a variable simply by assigning a value without let.

                    If you dont want this to be possible you can add the text

                        "use strict";

                const myBirthday = '18.04.1982'

                    Use capital letters in constants if values are known prior to execution

            Assignment: age = 25

            Both together: let age = 25

            conventions: camelCase

            \"quote\":  Escapes quotes so they are not interpreted.

            == compares value

            === compares value and type


    Ternary Operator ( ? )

        Shorthand way to write an if-else statement

        condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

        let num = 5;
        let result = num > 0 ? "positive" : "non-positive";
        console.log(result); // output: "positive"


    Functions

        Can have default values

        variables inside a function are only available locally.

        Returns values must be in one line or use parenthesis

        Return returns undefined


    Function expressions

        // Normal function
        function sayHi() {
             alert( "Hello" );
        }

        // Function Expression
        let sayHi = function() {
            alert( "Hello" );
        };

        Normal functions can be called at any point. JS reads funcions first.
        Function expressions can be called after being defined. 
        Function expressions have a semi-colon at the end. 
    

    Arrow functions

        let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;

        let sum = (a, b) => a + b;

        // Shorter form of:

        let sum = function(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        };
        
    While functions

        let number = 1;
        while (number <= 5) {
          console.log(number);
          number++;
        }

    For Loop

        let number;
        for (number = 1; number <= 5; number++) {
          console.log(number);
        }

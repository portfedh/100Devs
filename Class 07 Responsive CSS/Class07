    How to network, Part 1:

        The Goal: Turn a stranger into a friend

        Its not about coding, its about people wanting you on their team.

        This is the best time to network

        Dont just click apply


        Just have linkedin contacts that you know

            Add people by using messages

                He's an Aquaintance


        Go to Meetups

            Find where things are posted (local boards)

    Responsive basics

        Fluidity: Everything as a percentage.

        Elasticity: Setting our fonts and text as responsive.

            Em: Get font size from parent element.

            rem: Get the font size from the html elment. 

            You only make one change in parent element and everything will change.

        Content decisions:

            Using media queries

                Change sidebars

                Change navigational content

                Method 1: Large to small

                    Take a desktop web design

                    Shrink until it doesnt look good.

                    Add media queries and adapt it

                Method 2: Mobile first

                    Design it for mobile

                    Add media queries to enlarge it to desktop and tablet


        Media queries wont work in mobile

            You have to add add this to the html section in template:

                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

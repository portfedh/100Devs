    How to network Part 1:

        This is the best time to network

        Goal: Turn a stranger into a friend

        Its not about coding, its about people wanting you on their team.

        Dont just click apply

        Just have linkedin contacts that you know

            Add people by using messages

        Steps:
            Meet
            Acquaintance
            Friend
                Referal
            Ask for coworker

        Go to recurring events

            If you say hello to a person 3 days in a row: 
                He's an Aquaintance

        Go to meetups

            Find where things are posted (local boards)

            What other meetups do you go to.

            Try in other cities

        Go to conferences

            Volunteer to get in for free

            Go with a friend

        Dont eat alone

        Use the discord/twitter/fb comunity

        Tell your friends and family

        Who else should I talk too

        Send a followup email

            Add value

            Show you listened

            one thing per day
            spaced repetition

    Review

        CSS
            Rule
                Selector & declaration block
                    Declarations
                        Properties & values

    Responsive basics

        Fluidity: Everything as a percentage.

        Elasticity: Setting our fonts and text as responsive.

            Em: Get font size from parent element.

            rem: Get the font size from the html elment. 

            You only make one change in parent element and everything will change.

        Content decisions:

            Sidebars

            Navigational content

            Using media queries

                Option 1: Large to small
                    Take design
                    Shrink until it doesnt look good.
                    Add media querie

                Option 2: Mobile first

                    Preferable


        Remember to add to html section in template:

            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

            Media queries dont work in mobile if not.

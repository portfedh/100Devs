You need a comunity to get there.

Program: Fullstack Web Development.

$ 92,000 per year in the US.

Happiest paying jobs. 

Dont need a degree.

Its saturated of people that dont know what theyre doing. 

Learning to code is not the thing that will get you a job. 


Bootcamps spit out generic coders.

    Same projects in their portfolios.

    Causes code smell.


There is a window that is open. 

	Learn to code

	Learn to network

	Learn to differentiate yourself.

	The window will eventually close. 


	Learn the practical first.

		Once you get the job you fill in the gap.

		CS grads dont have practical skills. 

		They havent built in their network. 


	One language:

		JavaScript on front and back end. 

		Its the most in demand language. 

		You dont teach it in university


	Why not everyone does it

		Putting in the works takes a long time. 

		The troth of sorrow.

		Shoot for normal jobs, not FANG


	To get through the trough of sorrow, you have to get through the muck.


	Then wiggles of false hope.

		You have to network apply to 60 companies.

		Youll get two offers.


	Community is the only way to make it through. 

		When you get there, you pay it back for other two.


	Three things to help people learn.

		Managing frustration

		Consistency is the biggest factor to learn & retain.

		Take care of yourself

	Discord:

		Follow along materials channel. 

			Slides

			Link to check in

			Motivation quotes.

	Requirements:

		Network with 3 individuals already in tech

		Two coffee chat each week about their experience in tech

			How did they get there

			What are they learning

			What are they doing

		Coding challenge every day

		Homework

	
	Before talking or posting: Is this the nicest & most helpfull thing you can say

	How to study:

		Active recall

			Take notes as questions

			Use Anki

		Spaced repetition

	Goal

		To help you get the job

		To make money. No shame in that. 

		In the process you start to enjoy it.


	What is the internet

		Two kinds of computers:

			Clients: Our computers, with browser.

			Servers: Computer with code that lets it know what to do and response.

				HTML: Content.

				CSS: Color, style.

				JavaScript: Behaviour.

				Golden rule: Separation of concerns.

		Model like a kitchen:

			Clients make requests.

			Kitchen brings food back.

		They comunicate through networks

			ISP: Connects fiber cable to internet.

			DNS: Computer phonebook


		Full stack developers write code for client and server side.

			People 'bounce' if something doesnt load in 3 seconds.

		HTML5

			Websockets

			Video Audio, etc

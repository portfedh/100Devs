Instal npm

Navigate to your folder with the html file

    $ npm init

    Generate package.json

        Its a configuration file to save project information

    Install packages

        Example

            $ npm install moment --save

        Downloads file into a folder called 'node_modules'

        Modifies package.json to include the dependency

            Example

                {
                  "name": "modern-javascript-example",
                  "version": "1.0.0",
                  "description": "",
                  "main": "index.js",
                  "scripts": {
                    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
                  },
                  "author": "",
                  "license": "ISC",
                  "dependencies": {
                    "moment": "^2.22.2"
                  }
                }

    Share packages

        Share the package.json file

        $ npm install

    Use packages

        <script src="node_modules/moment/min/moment.min.js"></script>

        When you load files, all variables are global. 



NodeJs

    Part of CommonJs: An ecosystem for JS outside the browser.

    Its a serverside language that can access the computers filesystem.

    It knows the location of each npm module path automatically. 

    It uses a module bundler with a build step. 

        Browserify was very popular. 

        Webpack is currently the most used. 


Webpack

    Installing webpack:

        $ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

        Allows us to use webpack from the command line. 

        --save-dev: package you need for the dev enviroment, not for production server. 

    Run  webpack:

        $ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack index.js --mode=development

        --mode=development: Keeps JS readable
        --mode=production: Shortened output

        You need to run webpack each time we change index.js

        We run scripts with require statments insted of <script> tags


    Use code in html file:
        script src="dist/main.js"></script>


Transpilers

    Convert code from one language to a similar language. 

        CSS:
            Sass
            Less
            Stylus

        Javascript:
            CoffeScript
            Babel
            Typescript


Task runner

    Tool that automates different parts of the build process. 

        Minifying code

        Optimizing images

        Running tests

        Etc


Run npn

    $ npm run server

        Runs index.html

        localhost:8080

    $ npm run wath

        re-runs webpack everytime a Js file changes (for development).

    $ npm run build. 

        minimizes code for production

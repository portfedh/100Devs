## About 100Devs

[100Devs](https://100devs.org/) is a [brief description of the program and its goals]. This repository serves as a centralized location for organizing and storing all the materials related to my participation in the program.

## Repository Structure

- **Class ##:** Contains my class notes, completed homework assignments and the course material presented that day.
- **Class notes:** Notes taken during the program's lectures, with Key points, homework, and a transcription of the class. 
- **Class materials:** Materials and exercises viewed during the program.

Feel free to explore each directory to find specific materials for different weeks or topics.

Some homework was set on a class and given two or three weeks to finish, so it might be saved in a folder with notes on another subject.

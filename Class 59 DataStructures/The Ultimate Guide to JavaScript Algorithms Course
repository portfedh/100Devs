Notes

    Why

        If not planned we can use data structures that wont scale. 

        The best data structures consume minimal resources and store data in a meaningful way.

        Performance is measured by time spent & energy used.


    Data structures

        A way of storing data

    Algorithms

        Set of rules to be followed to perform a calculation.

        Usually a problem can be solved in more than one way.


    Big O Notation

        How execution time will as the input size changes.

    Jest & JsBench

        JS testing library for performance.

    Running tests

        $ npm run test <folder name>

    Simple algorithms

        String reversal

    Arrays

        Container object that is used to hold a list of items usually of same type.

    Objects

        Store a collection of data in the form of key-value pairs.

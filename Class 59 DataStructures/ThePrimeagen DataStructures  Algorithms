Notes:


Arrays are the simplest data structure

Big O
    Way to categorize time or memory as input grows.

    Helps us make decision what data structures to use

    We drop the constants O(n) == O(1) == O(2)


Arrays

    Blocking contiguous space.

    Example 

    Create an array of 3 bites:

        a = int[3]

    a[0]

        Go to the memory address of A

        Add in the offset of 0 multiplied by how big my type is (in this case 3)

    Arrays cant be empty

        You can fill them with a symbol

        What if you want to use that symbol

        Thats how 'null' was invented


    Has O(1)

        No matter how big the index is, it takes the same amount of time. 


    insertAt, push(), pop()

        Built on top of this

        Where it is, how many boxes it has, unit size per box in bits.

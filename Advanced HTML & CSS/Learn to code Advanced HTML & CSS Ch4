-------------------------------

Mobile internet is outpacing general internet growth.
Soon the majority of internet comsumption will be on mobile devices.

Responsive Overview

    A website suitable to work on every divice and every screen size. 

Responsive vs Adaptive vs Mobile

    Responsive dynamically adapts sites react to changes

    Adaptive are built to preset factors.

    Mobile means a separate website for mobile users.


Flexible Layouts
    
    Flexible layouts

        Using a flexible grid
            genmerformula:
                Result = target / context

        Capable of resizing to any width
            Resizing may not be enough
            Text may become to large or too small
            When this happens we switch to media queries
        
        Built in relative length units 
            percentages
            em units
            vw (viewports width)
            vmin (Minimum of the viewports height and width)
            vh (Viewports height)
            vmax (Maximum of the viewports height and width)

    Media queries

        Dont work with Internet Explorer 8 and below

        Ability to specify different styles for individual
            Browsers
            Device circumstances
                screen
                print
                tv
                braile
                3d-glasses
            Example:
                /* @media Rule */
                @media all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

        Logical operators

            and
                @media all and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

            not
                @media not screen and (color) {...}

            only
                @media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {...}
                Hide stilyes from devices that dont support media queries.

            If media type is not specified, it will default to all. 


        Media Features

            Height and Width
                min-width
                min-height
                max-width
                max-height
                @media all and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 780px) {...}
                    min & max refer to <= and >=

            Orientation
                landscape
                portrait
                all
                @media all and (orientation: landscape) {...}

            Aspect Ratio
                aspect-ratio
                device-aspect-ratio
                    width/height pixel ration
                @media all and (min-device-aspect-ratio: 16/9) {...}

            Pixel Ratio (identify high definition devices)
                @media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.3), only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.3) {...}

            Resolution Media Feature

                Specifies the resolution of the output device in pixel density
                @media print and (min-resolution: 300dpi) {...}

            Other Media Features
                color
                color-index
                monochrome
                grid feature
                scan

            Identifying breakpoints

                Add media queries when a website starts to break.
                Not for common device sizes, since they change all the time.

            Mobile First

                Use styles targeting smaller viewports as default.
                Use media queries as viewport grows.
                
                    /* Default styles first then media queries */
                    @media screen and (min-width: 400px)  {...}

                Can also help so you dont download uneccesary media.

                    /* Media for larger devices */
                    @media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
                      body {
                        background-image: url("bg.png") 50% 50% no-repeat;
                      }
                    }

            Viewport

                Identifying the viewport size, scale and resolution of a website.

                The viewport meta tag will tell the browser the intended width of a website.
                    Uses height or width values.
                    Will define the height or width of the viewport. 

                    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">

            Viewport Scale

                Control how a website is scaled on a mobile device.
                    
                    Properties:
                        minimum-scale (positive value lower than initial value)
                        maxiumum-scale (positive value larger than initial value)
                        initial-scale (should be 1 in a scale 0-10)
                        user-scalable ('no' will disable zooming)

                    Values above 1 will zoom the website
                    <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=yes">

            Viewport Resolution

                The browser can decide how to scale a website.
                It uses viewport scale values. 

                If more control is needed, you can use these properties:
                    target-densitydpi
                    device-dpi
                    high-dpi
                    medium-dpi
                    low-dpi
                    actual dpi number
                    <meta name="viewport" content="target-densitydpi=device-dpi">


            Combining Viewport Values

                multiple values are allowed at once.
                Requires comma separation

                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

            Viewport Rule

                Rather than using a viewport meta tag

                Use a CSS rule:

                @viewport {
                  width: device-width;
                  zoom: 1;
                }

    Flexible media

        Images, videos and other need to be scalable. 

        Use max-width property:

            img, video, canvas {
              max-width: 100%;
            }

    What is freelancing

        Proving you have already worked

            Reduces risk for other employers

            Freelancing is the way to re-risk yourself

        They pay you for business value you provide

        Working as an independent person

            Setting it up takes 6 months

            Conversation

            Always be closing: Dont hang up until you agree to a $100 package or the hang up. 

                Thousands of people are searching for restaurants to eat and you are not even competing because you dont have a website.

                Individuals under 35 are more likely to eat at a restaurant who have a website

                People are trying to find you online

            This sounds like an amazing project. There is a lot here.

                If we agreee great. If not, im happy to connect you with somee other freelancers that may work at your budget. 

                I dont do hourly rates. I dont want to get punished for being good.

            Setup the next meeting to discuss the proposal

                Negotiate on time instead of money

Notes:

    CSS Id's
        Can only be used once in an html file.

    !important
        CSS tag
        Worth 1,000 points

    You build sites with classes & Id's 
        If you only use relationship selectors: <h1>
        And people change the structure, it breaks.

        User interphase
        The things you interact with and sww

    * { box-sizing: boder-box;}
        Changes box model so borders are inside width and height
        1/3 1/3 1/3 Floats will fit on a line. 

    clear: both;
        So the content wont go below the floated items but after them.

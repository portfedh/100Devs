    What is Flexbox

        CSS layout that provides an easy way to arrange items

        No floats

        Responsive and mobile friendly

        Easier

        Margins don't collapse

        Order of the elements can be changed without changing html

        Direction agnostic (horizontal or vertical)
        
        For small scaled layouts (grid for larger layout)


    Container

        Has a flex container
        
        Has an main (x axis) and a cross axis (y axis)

        Main properties:

            display: flex;

            flex-direction: row;

            flex-wrap: wrap;

            flex-basis: <length>;

            justify-content: flex-start;

            align-self: flex-start;

            align-content: flex-start;

            flex-grow: <number>;

            flex-shrink: <number>;

            flex: <integer>;

            order: <integer>;

    Tutorial

        Multiple columns in one row:

            display: flex;

                Used in the container element. 

        Different proportions for each column:

            flex: 1;
            flex: 2;
            ...

                Relative size of the flex object. 

                Code added in the child element.

        Change the order of the elements:

            order: 1;
            order: 2;
            ...

                Code in the child element

                Will re-arrange objects


        Align text inside elements to the top:

            align-items: flex-start;

                Code in the child element


        Change direction to arrange <div>'s vertically

            flex-direction: column;

                Code inside container


        Add margin to containers:

            Determine the width of your child container

                width: 25%;

                You can also use flexbox syntax

                flex-basis: 25%;


            justify-content: space-around;

                Code goes in container

                Needs child items to sum less than 100%


        To make everything into one column in a phone:

            @media(min-width:468px){
    
                .container-1{
                /* display:flex; */
                }
                
                .container-2{
                display:flex; 
                }
            }

        To wrap columns so they get pushed down if screen is too small:

            flex-wrap: wrap;

                Code goes in container

                Will wrap until there are two rows (*check this)

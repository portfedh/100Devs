Notes:
    Progressive Enhancement:
        Priorities:
            Content
            Presentation
            Client-side scripting
        Many places lack access to broadband
        Lite version of the site for less band

    HTML 
        <!DOCTYPE html>
            Lets the browser know what html version you are using
            html means html5

        <html></html>
            Root tag (element)
            Anything inside is a child
            Elemen

    	<head></head>
            Child of <html> element
            Anything the browser the needs to run the page.

    	<body></body>
            Child of <html> element
            Eveything we can see and interact with.

        Autogenerate with VS Code
            Write html and hit tab
            Select html:5 and hit enter


    New tags:

        <nav></nav>
            Navigation content at the top of the page
            List of links used for navigation
            So SEO ignores the content 

        <form action= "confirmation.html" method="post">
          <!-- Data Collection elements go here -->
          <label for="zebra">First Name:</label>
          <input id="zebra" type="text">
          <input type="tel">
          <input type="email">
          <!-- inputs look the same in web, but help keyboard on mobile -->
        </form>

        Form input types:
            Text
            Password
            Tel
            Email
            Button
            MDN has full list

    Progressive Enhancement:

        The core of our website is our content (html)

        Presentation (secondary)

        Client side scripting (terciary)
